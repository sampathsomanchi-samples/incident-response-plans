# AI Incident Response Playbooks (Chatbots / LLMs)

Repository of concise incident response playbooks and artifacts for LLM-powered chatbots.
Created as a scaffold for SOC / SecOps teams to store playbooks, detection rules, IAM examples, and log samples.

Structure:

- references/: supporting references and mappings
- artifacts/: iam, logs, detection signatures, templates
